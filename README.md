- **IPFS Metadata**: Decentralized storage for carbon credit certificates and metadata
- **The Graph Integration**: Efficient blockchain data indexing and querying
- **Mobile-First**: Beautiful React Native app with production-ready UI

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract (Polygon PoS)
- **ERC-1155** standard for carbon credits
- **Role-based access control** (Issuer, Verifier, Admin)
- **Retirement tracking** with reasons and timestamps
- **Metadata management** with IPFS integration

### Backend Services
- **Node.js/Express** API server
- **MongoDB** for off-chain data storage
- **IPFS** integration for metadata storage
- **The Graph** subgraph for blockchain data indexing
- **ethers.js** for blockchain interactions

### React Native App
- **Expo SDK 52** with Expo Router
- **WalletConnect v2** for wallet integration
- **Real-time updates** from blockchain events
- **Offline support** with AsyncStorage caching

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
